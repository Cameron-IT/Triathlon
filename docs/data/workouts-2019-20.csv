You are flirting with that 2 min/hundred and it is important to keep working at it. The fact that you held that pace for 2 intervals means it was not badly paced. If you went out the first 200 in 4:00 and then died, then we know you were too aggressive.* *01/14/2020 Cameron Isaacs-Trepanier: That’s good to know. It helps me understand what you mean by “don’t go out too fast”. For sure that this one was rough.

Examples of intervals: - strength intervals at high loads:5x 5 min up to 3x15 min at 250 with 3-5 rest - 8 x 3 min at 250 w with 3 min rest; work up to 10 min intervals. Decrease reps with increased interval times. After 3-4 weeks of training at these levels, do an FTP test. I can do this in person if you’d like, I can help him run it at a higher wattage. Just some ideas, but I would have him work in intervals above 230w, and work up to longer intervals, just to get ready for an FTP test, at which point I’m sure his results will reveal an even higher number.","","","2020-02-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I almost cancelled the workout, but I stopped and stretched it out. It hurt quite a bit when turning and going up hill, so I shortened my stride length and slowed down during those sections. The last 7 minutes were pretty bad too. On flats and down hill I had no issues.

It could be a function of course/group ride. For this ride, my total time vs time spent moving is exactly the same. It’s never that close when I do group rides because we stop half way for people to use the washroom/eat (probably not that great for my fitness gains). Also, my normalized power looks much better for this. Another thought I’ve been having is about my IF. I’m finding for anything over and hour, I cannot push my IF higher than 0.8. That makes me think my muscular endurance isn’t quite there. What do you think about that? Alternatively, it  may be hard to achieve because the routes I take usually have a negative elevation profile on the second half, so I exert much less energy in the second half. In the first half I’m obviously not pushing 0.9 IF, which would even it out. These are just a few thoughts I’ve been having because it seems so hard for me to average 30kph on most these routes (I know it’s not a great metric).*","1.47475934028625","7.96199989318848","","85","","144","162","","","0.79435961330235","92.48","22","51","15","1","0","0","0","","","","18","29","21","13","5","3","","","","","8","5"
