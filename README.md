# Triathlon
Analyses of my triathlon data. I have been a triathlete since 2018, but my training became a lot more serious in 2019 when I realized how much I enjoyed endurance sports. Each year, I will produce a report that goes over my training for that year. I will then use the data to decide where I have been doing well in training and to identify areas of improvement. If you think I should do additional analyses, please reach out to me. I would be happy to go exploring through the plethora of data I have captured (about 500 entries a year).

My reports are produced using R notebooks and published as html files. Therefore, I use a bit of html code for formatting and the data is processed, analyzed, and visualized using R. I chose notebooks because I can create reproducible reports using the same template every year. It also helps you follow along by showing the code chunks that produce the summary data, visuals, and charts I have created. It's quite transparent! That is the way I like it.
